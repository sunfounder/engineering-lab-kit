1.2 What's Included in Your Kit
======================================


Inside our kit, you'll find a variety of components and parts you'll use throughout this course to build circuits. Here's a quick guide to what's included.


**1 x Original Arduino Uno R3**

A microcontroller board that's the brain of your circuits. It has everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to your computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

**120 x Resistors (10 of each, 30 of 220Ω resistor)**

A resistor is a component that obstructs the flow of electric power, thereby altering the voltage and current within a circuit. The value of a resistor is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Ω). The colored stripes on a resistor indicate its resistance value and tolerance.

**25 x LEDs (5 of each color)**

This colorful LED selection includes five colors: red, green, blue, yellow, and white, meeting various lighting and signaling needs. Suitable for applications ranging from simple status indicators to complex decorative lighting projects, these LEDs offer a rich color choice to enhance the visual appeal of any electronic project.

**1 x Potentiometer**

A potentiometer is a variable resistor with three pins. Two pins connect to the ends of a resistor, while the middle pin attaches to a movable wiper, dividing the resistor into two parts. Potentiometers, often used to adjust voltage in circuits, are like the volume knobs on radios.

**1 x 74HC595 Chip**

The 74HC594 is a shift register that is used to expand the input/output ports of digital circuits by converting serial input into parallel output, thus reducing the number of connection pins needed. This chip is suitable for controlling a large number of output devices, such as 7-segment Display, without occupying too many microcontroller pins.

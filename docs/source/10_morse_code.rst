10. Morse Code
========================

Morse code is like a secret language using dots (.) and dashes (-) invented by Samuel Morse in the 1840s. It was created to send messages across long distances using telegraphs. Each letter of the alphabet and number is represented by a unique combination of these signals. For example, the most famous Morse code message is "SOS" (¬∑¬∑¬∑ ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì ¬∑¬∑¬∑), which is an international signal for help. Morse code used to be essential for communication before the invention of phones and the internet, and it was especially popular among ship and airplane operators. Today, it's fun to learn as a way to send secret messages to your friends!

In this lesson, you will learn:

* Understand the workings of an active buzzer.
* Learn to code the SOS signal in Morse code, enabling you to send messages using Morse code with a buzzer.


Morse Code Magic!
-------------------

.. image:: img/7_morse.jpeg

Imagine inventing a way to send secret messages using just dots and dashes! That's what Samuel Morse did back in 1836 with Morse code. Initially a painter, Morse got inspired on a boat trip and later, with his buddy Alfred Vail, created the telegraph to send messages across wires.

Morse code uses dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals) to represent letters and numbers. The first Morse code message? "What hath God wrought"‚Äîsent in 1844 from Washington D.C. to Baltimore, kicking off the telegraph era.

Today, Morse code isn't used as much, but it's still cool for things like aviation and by amateur radio fans. Now, let's explore how Morse code works with Arduino and a buzzer and have some fun with this piece of communication history!

**Building Step-by-Step**

1. Locate an active buzzer which typically has a white sticker on the front and a sealed black back.

.. image:: img/7_beep_2.png

Buzzers, as electronic sound devices, have a rich history that traces back to the 19th century. The precursor to modern buzzers is rooted in 1831, when Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, forming the foundational principle behind the operation of electromagnetic buzzers. Following Faraday's groundbreaking discovery, many scientists and inventors explored how to apply electromagnetic theories to practical devices. Today, Buzzers can be categorized as active and passive ones:

**Active Buzzer**

.. image:: img/7_beep_ac.png
    :width: 300
    :align: center

Sealed at the back, active buzzers contain an internal oscillator that sounds when powered, typically producing a single-tone beep.

**Passive Buzzer**

.. image:: img/7_beep_pa.png
    :width: 300
    :align: center

Open at the back, passive buzzers require an external frequency signal from a microcontroller to generate sound, allowing for a range of tones.

1. Active buzzer is also polar device. The front side has a "+" sign indicating its positive terminal (anode), which is also the longer pin. Now insert the buzzer into the breadboard with the anode in hole 15F and the cathode in hole 18F.

.. image:: img/16_morse_code_buzzer.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center

2. Connect the cathode to the GND pin on the Arduino Uno R3.

.. image:: img/16_morse_code_gnd.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center

3. If you insert the anode of the buzzer into the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno R3, you will hear the active buzzer emit sound directly. Of course, you can also use this method to verify if the buzzer you have is correct. A passive buzzer will not produce sound when directly connected to a power source.

4. Now, remove the wire inserted into the 5V pin and insert it into pin 9 of the Arduino Uno R3, so that the buzzer can be controlled with code.

Code Creation - Make the buzzer sound
-----------------------------------------------
1. Open the Arduino IDE and start a new project by selecting ‚ÄúNew Sketch‚Äù from the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu.
2. Save your sketch as ``Lesson10_Beep`` using ``Ctrl + S`` or by clicking ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.

3. First, create a constant called ``buzzerPin`` and set it equal to pin 9.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 1

    const int buzzerPin = 9;   // Assigns the pin 9 to the constant for the buzzer

    void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
    }

4. Initialize the pin: In the ``void setup()`` function, set the buzzer pin to output mode.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    const int buzzerPin = 9;   // Assigns the pin 9 to the constant for the buzzer

    void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 9 as output
    }

5. Making an active buzzer sound an alert is as simple as lighting an LED; you just need to use ``digitalWrite()`` to set pin 9 high or low and ``delay()`` to control the timing.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 10-13

    const int buzzerPin = 9;   // Assigns the pin 9 to the constant for the buzzer

    void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 9 as output
    }

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);  // Turn buzzer ON
        delay(250);                     // Beep duration: 250 milliseconds
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);   // Turn buzzer OFF
        delay(250);                     // Interval between signals: 250 milliseconds
    }

6. You can upload your code to the Arduino Uno R3, and then you will hear the "beep beep" sound.

Code Creation - "SOS"
--------------------------
Now to write the code to make the buzzer signal in Morse code.

In Morse code, there are traditional timing rules for dots (short signals), dashes (long signals), and the intervals between signals to ensure the message is accurately received and understood. Here are some basic rules:

    * Length of a dot: the basic time unit.
    * Length of a dash: equals three dots.
    * Interval between dots: the length of one dot.
    * Interval within a character (between dots and dashes of a letter or number): the length of one dot.
    * Interval between characters (e.g., between two letters): three dots.
    * Interval between words (e.g., between two words): seven dots.

1. Open the Arduino IDE and start a new project by selecting ‚ÄúNew Sketch‚Äù from the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu.
2. Save your sketch as ``Lesson10_Morse_Code`` using ``Ctrl + S`` or by clicking ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.

3. First, initialize the pin connected to the buzzer.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    const int buzzerPin = 9;   // Assigns the pin 9 to the constant for the buzzer

    void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 9 as output
    }

4. Now let's create a function for emitting dots (short signals). Throughout your coding journey, you've already been using built-in Arduino functions such as ``pinMode()``, ``digitalWrite()``, and ``delay()``. Now, we'll dive into creating custom functions. Custom functions allow you to simplify your code, making it more logical and manageable.

To create a function, simply add it to the bottom of your sketch after the ``void loop()`` brace. Like ``void setup()`` and ``void loop()``, functions start with void followed by a name you choose. The naming rules for functions are similar to those for variables or constants. You can name a function anything that isn't a keyword in the Arduino IDE, and you enclose its commands within curly braces.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 9,10

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);  // Turn buzzer ON
        delay(250);                     // Beep duration: 250 milliseconds
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);   // Turn buzzer OFF
        delay(250);                     // Interval between signals: 250 milliseconds
    }

    void dot() {
    }

5. In the created function void dot(), set the time interval for a dot to 250ms.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 9-14

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);  // Turn buzzer ON
        delay(250);                     // Beep duration: 250 milliseconds
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);   // Turn buzzer OFF
        delay(250);                     // Interval between signals: 250 milliseconds
    }

    void dot() {
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
        delay(250);  // Short duration for a dot
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
        delay(250);  // Interval between signals
    }

6. Now, create another function for emitting dashes (long signals). According to the basic rules of Morse code, set the time interval for a dash to 3 times that of a dot (750ms).

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 8-13

    void dot() {
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
        delay(250);  // Short duration for a dot
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
        delay(250);  // Interval between signals
    }

    void dash() {
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
        delay(750);  // Longer duration for a dash
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
        delay(250);  // Interval between signals
    }

7. Now, you can transmit Morse code. For example, to send "SOS" (... --- ...), the Morse code for 'S' consists of three dots, and 'O' is three dashes, so you simply call the dot and dash functions three times respectively.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 2-11

    void loop() {
        dot();
        dot();
        dot();  // S: ...
        dash();
        dash();
        dash();  // O: ---
        dot();
        dot();
        dot();       // S: ...
        delay(750);  // Repeat after a period
    }

8. Here is your complete code. You can now click "Upload" to upload the code to the Arduino Uno R3, after which you will hear the Morse code for "SOS" (... --- ...).

.. code-block:: Arduino

    const int buzzerPin = 9;   // Assigns the pin 9 to the constant for the buzzer
    
    void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 9 as output
    }

    void loop() {
        dot();
        dot();
        dot();  // S: ...
        dash();
        dash();
        dash();  // O: ---
        dot();
        dot();
        dot();       // S: ...
        delay(750);  // Repeat after a period
    }

    void dot() {
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
        delay(250);  // Short duration for a dot
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
        delay(250);  // Interval between signals
    }

    void dash() {
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
        delay(750);  // Longer duration for a dash
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
        delay(250);  // Interval between signals
    }


9. Finally, remember to save your code and tidy up your workspace.

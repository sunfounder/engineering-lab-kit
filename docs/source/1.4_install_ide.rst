1.4 Install Arduino IDE
==========================

Exciting times ahead! Now that we've introduced Arduino and its board, let's get our hands dirty by installing the Arduino IDE. This software is your toolbox for programming the Arduino board to do all the amazing things you've imagined.

The latest iteration, Arduino IDE 2.0, is both feature-rich and user-friendly. Before diving in, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Windows**: Win 10 or newer, 64-bit
- **Linux**: 64-bit
- **Mac OS X**: Version 10.14 "Mojave" or newer, 64-bit

Follow these steps to get set up:

For Windows Users
-------------------------

1. Head to the |link_download_arduino|, where you'll find the Arduino IDE available for three different operating systems. For Windows users, there are three versions to choose from:

    * **Windows Win 10 and newer, 64 bits (Installer)**: Recommended for most users. Automatically installs needed drivers.
    
    * **Windows MSI Installer**: Suitable for network deployment or if you prefer MSI over a standard setup.
    
    * **Windows ZIP File**: Offers a portable version that doesn't require installation. Ideal if you're using multiple PCs or lack admin rights. Manual driver installation may be needed.

2. After downloading (the file will be named like ``arduino-ide_xxxx.exe``), double-click it to initiate installation.

3. Read through the **License Agreement**. If you're okay with the terms, click "I Agree".

For macOS Users
-----------------------

1. Head to the |link_download_arduino|, where you'll find the Arduino IDE tailored for different operating systems. For macOS users, there are two specialized versions:

    * **macOS Intel, 10.15 "Catalina" or newer, 64 bits**: This version is designed for Macs with Intel processors. It's optimized to ensure smooth operation on macOS versions from Catalina onwards, supporting the latest features and security standards of macOS on Intel architecture.
    
    * **macOS Apple Silicon, 11 "Big Sur" or newer, 64 bits**: Specifically crafted for the latest generation of Macs with Apple Silicon chips, this version offers enhanced performance and efficiency on macOS Big Sur and later. It leverages the advanced capabilities of Apple's own chips to provide an optimized Arduino development experience.

For Linux Users
--------------------

1. Visit the |link_download_arduino|, where the Arduino IDE is available for three different operating systems. For Linux users, two options are provided:

    * **Linux AppImage 64 bits (X86-64)**: This version comes as an AppImage, which is a type of portable software package. It doesn't require installation; simply make the file executable and run it directly.

    * **Linux ZIP file 64 bits (X86-64)**: This is a ZIP file containing the IDE. It's suitable for users who prefer manually managing their installations or need a portable version of the IDE.

2. Navigate to your download folder. Before we can start the editor, the file needs to be executable. Right-click the file, choose **Properties**.

3. In the **Permissions** tab, tick "Allow executing file as a program".

4. Now, double-click the file to launch Arduino IDE 2 on your Linux machine. If you're unable to run the AppImage, ensure that FUSE is installed on your system.
